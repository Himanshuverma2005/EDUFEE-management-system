## üö® Problem: Confirmation emails not being sent after signup

This guide will help you configure Supabase to send confirmation emails.

## üîß Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard

2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your project

### Step 2: Configure Authentication Settings

### Step 4: Configure Email Provider

You have two options:

   - Gmail: Use App Password
   - SendGrid: Use API Key
   - Mailgun: Use SMTP credentials

2. **Fill in SMTP settings:**
   ```
   Host: smtp.gmail.com (or your provider)
   Port: 587
   Username: your-email@gmail.com
   Password: your-app-password
   ```

### Step 5: Customize Email Templates

1. **Click on "Email Templates"**
2. **Find "Confirm signup" template**
3. **Customize the content:**

**Subject:** Confirm Your Email - EduFees Management System
